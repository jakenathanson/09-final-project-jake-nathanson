Welcome to Your 2018 Rides in Review
Let's take a look back on your 2018 through UberÂ® Rides. We will need you to grant access to your basic ride history, we never store or share your information. See how many rides you took in 2018, how many miles you traveled in 2018, how many cities you visisted in 2018, and more! Uber does not give us personally identifiable information and your location history is restricted to only cities not exact location!
